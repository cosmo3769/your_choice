                <h6><em>What is Arduino?</em></h6>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction" class="links"><ins>Arduino</ins></a> is an open source electronics platform 
                    which provides easy to use hardware and software which can be used for making various projects, gadgets and also for prototyping etc. 
                    Arduino makes different types of boards to serve different specific purposes and the boards can take different inputs and turn it 
                    into the output. We can do many stuffs using any of these boards but today we are going to learn about a particular 
                    board i.e. “Arduino UNO”. So let's jump into the details of the board and learn how we can use it to make our desired gadget.

                </p>
                <h4><em><u>Arduino UNO</u></em></h4>

                <h4><em><ins>Parts Explained</ins></em></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>ATmega328p :-</em> It is the main microcontroller of the board which does all the computing for the board and stores the 
                        programs or the instructions. We also call it the brain of the board(<i><small> just like the CPU is for computers </small></i>). It 
                        is a 8-bit microcontroller.</li>
                    <li><i>ATmega16U2 :-</i> It is the small microcontroller which is responsible for communication with the USB. It translates the data 
                        which comes 
                        via USB cable into something which is understandable by the main processor.</li>
                        <p>
                    <em>Note :- The main processor communicates using serial communication. Serial communication is the process of communication where data is 
                        sent over a channel one bit at a time. So the board needs ATmega16U2 for communicating via USB. </em>
                        </p>
                   <li><i>Power pins :-</i> Power pins are for either supplying power to       
                        the board or drawing out power from the board to run some 
                        output devices like led, buzzers, shields etc.
                        Following pins are power pins with their description :-
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Vin :-</em> It is the pin for powering arduino. It takes voltage 
                                upto 7 to 12 volts(labeled) but the recommended voltage is
                                6 to 9 volt.
                            </li>
                            <li><em>5v :-</em> It is the pin for supplying 5 volt to any electronic 
                                components connected to the board. It can draw upto 400mA of 
                                current over a USB power supply.
                            </li>
                            <li><em>3.3v :-</em> It is the pin for supplying 3.3 volt to any 
                                electronic component connected to the board.</li>
                            <li><em>GND :-</em> It is the negative pin which act as negative end for 
                                completing the electrical circuit.
                            </li>
                            <li><em>Reset :-</em> Reset pin is used to reset the arduino via an 
                                external button(<small> if connected to that pin </small>).
                            </li>
                            <li><em>IOREF :-</em> This pin provides the voltage reference with which 
                                the microcontroller operates. It can be used by some shields 
                                to select the appropriate power source.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><em>USB Plug :-</em> USB plug is just a simple B-type USB port which 
                        is used to connect the board via computer or laptop. It is 
                        necessary for programming the board. This pin also powers 
                        the board as USB cables draw power according to the need of 
                        device it connected to for example you can charge your phone 
                        with your laptop using USB cable.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Power Plug :-</em> It is used to supply power to arduino from an  
                        A.C source by using an ac to dc adapter. The recommended 
                        voltage is 7 to 12 volt but board can work on 6 to 20 volt 
                        supply.
                        <i>Note :- You must not supply more than 12 volt to the board it 
                            will overheat the voltage regulator and damage the board.
                        </i>
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Digital I/O pins :-</em> There are total 14 digital input output pins on the board(<small>6 of them which are PWM pins</small>). As the 
                        name suggest these pins are for taking input and 
                        giving output in the form of digital signals i.e. 0 or 1.
                        These pins are numbered from 2 to 13 on the board.
                    </li>
                         <i> Note :- Pin with ~ as the prefix are pwm pins we will be   
                            discussing pwm in the later part of this tutorial.
                        </i>
                    <li><em>ANALOG IN :-</em> These pins are for taking analog inputs from 
                        the electronic input devices such as sensors etc. They are 6 
                        in numbers and labeled as A0 to A5 on the board.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Serial Out and Serial IN :-</em> Both are responsible for the 
                        Communication of two arduino boards. ‘Serial out’ is labelled 
                        as “TX” and it transmits the signal to the different board.
                        ‘Serial In’ is labelled as “RX” and it receives the signal 
                        from the board. Both of them are also used to connect board 
                        with some of the shields.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Digital ground :-</em> It is same as the ground and labelled as 
                        “GND”.
                    
                    </li>
                    <li><em>In Circuit Serial Programmers(ICSP) :-</em> There are two 
                        ICSP pins on the board the pin near the main processor is 
                        for programming the firmware and the bootloader of the 
                        processor similarly the port near the ATmega16U2 is used  
                        for programming the firmware of this microcontroller. This
                        type of programming is known as AVR Programming or direct 
                        programming.
                   
                    </li>
                    <i>
                        Note :- firmware is the code which is prewritten in the
                         Flash(ROM)Of the microcontroller. It is a low level code.
                    </i>
                    <li><em>Crystal Oscillator :-</em> Crystal oscillator provides a clock 
                        Signal to the main processor. It provides a square wave
                        signal which determines the time required for each T 
                        state. It has a clock speed of 16Mhz. Basically it is 
                        responsible for the speed of the board.
                  </li>
                  <li><em>Voltage Regulator :-</em> It regulates the voltage supplied to
                       the board. The arduino operates on 5 volt so its duty is 
                       to limit the excess voltage to the 5 volt. It gets
                       Overheated if the supply voltage is greater than 12 
                       volts.
                  </li>
                  <li><em>Voltage Comparator :-</em> If the arduino is connected with 
                        multiple power sources at the same time then this
                        Comparator decides which one to use.
                   </li>
                         <i>
                            For example your board is connected with USB and you have
                            also given a power supply of 6 volt via‘Vin’ pin then the 
                            comparator will divide the voltage through ‘Vin’ by 2 and 
                            then check whether it is &gt3.3v or &lt3.3v, if it is less 
                            than 3.3v then it will send this supply to the ground pin 
                            else it will send it to the voltage regulator and then 
                            Voltage regulator will cut the supply from the USB and 
                            hence board will be powered via the Vin source. So 6.6 is 
                            minimum voltage to cut the USB supply.
                     
                         </i>
                    <li><em>Reset Button :-</em> It resets the arduino and the programs 
                        written starts to execute from the line one. It doesn't
                        delete the uploaded program.
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <h4><em><u>Specifications</u></em></h4>
                <p>Now you know almost all the components present on the board. So lets move forward to learn about the working of the board 
                    but before that we will take a quick look at the few specifications of the board.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microcontroller : Microchip ATmega328P</li>
                    <li>Operating Voltage : 5 Volts</li>

                    <li>Weight : 25 g</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Above are the few specifications of the board. As you know that the main processor of the board is ATmega328P and the 
                    board operates on the 5 volts. The board is a digital board which means it sends output digitally i.e. in 0 and 1 (0=0volts and 1=5volts).
                </p>
                <h4><em><u>Working of the board</u></em></h4>
                <p>Board works according to your instructions. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the 
                    microcontroller on the board. To do so you use <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/"><u>The Arduino programming language</u></a> 
                    and the Arduino software(IDE).</p>
                <p>This board works on digital signals; it can't send/transmit analog signals. For those who don’t know what digital signal and 
                    analog signal is :- <em>Digital signals are electrical signals which can only be in two states i.e. 0 or 1 / on or off / high or low.
                    Analog signals are continuous electrical signals which range from 0 to 1024.
                    </em> But we can use digital signals as analog signals by PWM(<small> pulse width modulation </small>). Pulse width modulation is a 
                    method of getting analog results by digital means. In this method we chop the digital signals effectively with respect to time and 
                    get the desired output. For example :- <em>Suppose a motor runs at a full speed on 5v supply and we have a 5v supply which. 
                    But we want it to run at half of its speed. We will use PWM for this, motor does not start to run at the full speed as soon as we 
                    power it, it takes some time to get it full speed so what we will do we'll give it 5v supply until it get to rotate at half of its 
                    speed and then we will shift the supply to 0v and again we will give it 5v after a calculated time interval so that it maintain its 
                    speed at half of the max speed and this will result in continuous movement of motor at half of its speed.</em>
                    This is an important concept so keep this in mind we will know how to use it when we enter the programming part of the board.
                    So let us learn how we can program the board.
                </p>
                <h4><em><u>Programming of the Board</u></em></h4>
                <p>By programming the board we can send our instructions to the board. So in this section we will learn about ‘Arduino IDE’ and 
                    take the overview of the ‘Arduino programming language’.</p>
                <h6><em><u>ARDUINO IDE</u></em></h6>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino_IDE"><u>Arduino IDE</u></a> is a cross platform application (for windows, macOS, linux) 
                    that is written in function from C and C++. Basically it's an application for programming arduino compatible boards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can program the arduino using some different softwares also but the arduino IDE is best and easy to use and it is also distributed by 
                    the arduino itself. So i will recommend you to use the desktop IDE but you can also program the arduino using
                    <a href="https://login.arduino.cc/login?state=g6Fo2SBkZTUwVWV5TV8tQ1p4Mm1rZ0pEU1lzSXN0Q0xEN0hRVqN0aWTZIGdKVUFkRy1sbF85dXlMNGxxNU1OaTR6bGFxM2VaSmQwo2NpZNkgcnI2TFNPU3o1N2g3ZnZzSGRSWFhQa1pHM0VSb1hUZlo&client=rr6LSOSz57h7fvsHdRXXPkZG3ERoXTfZ&protocol=oauth2&authorizeTimeoutInSeconds=5&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcreate.arduino.cc%2Feditor&logout_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcreate.arduino.cc&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.arduino.cc&scope=openid%20profile%20email&skipAutoLogin=true&response_type=code&response_mode=query&nonce=SkFyb0NMQVV6MktYVE91dEx2Qks5bDBZV0otRVFPQXBCdlBkNXZsWVNPTQ%3D%3D&code_challenge=yWgjSjWY798Ll1CgcxTqHpzpjNU4JOYEO2l_o9zajas&code_challenge_method=S256&auth0Client=eyJuYW1lIjoiYXV0aDAtc3BhLWpzIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6IjEuOC4xIn0%3D#/login"></a>.

                <p>
                    After extracting the file go to the folder where you extracted it and double click on the arduino.exe file to open it. After opening 
                    the IDE you will see this screen on your desktop or laptop.

                    <figcaption>Main screen of the arduino IDE</figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>In the above picture just below the menu bar there is round shaped icon with a tick mark on it i.e. the icon for compile
                    By clicking on that icon you can compile your code(<i>Compiling means converting your source code into machine code cause the machine 
                        only understands binary language</i>). Just beside the compile icon arrow marked icon is present this icon is for uploading 
                        the code to the board. After successfully compiling your code you should upload your code to the board using the ‘USB cable’ 
                        one end connected to your laptop and the other end to your board. This was about IDE but what should we write in our 
                        code we will take some overview in the upcoming section.
                </p>
                <h4><em><u>Code part of programming the board </u></em></h4>
                <p>In the previous section we learned how to use IDE to upload the code to the board. In this section we will get an overview of 
                    what we should write in the code and how we can learn coding it.
                    According to me coding is a never ending learning process there is always a chance to write something new it has endless 
                    possibilities.So no one can teach you how to code you have to learn it by doing yourself. Coding is just a language in which 
                    you can communicate with machines and a good communication requires two things: a common language and thoughts which you want to 
                    share. So get your thoughts on what you want to do with your board, learn the basics of coding search on google how u can achieve 
                    it and don’t stop until it's done. Google is the most important tool while learning so use it for your every query after 
                    giving a thought on how you can solve it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s come to the overview, before getting into the coding part, I wanna tell you that arduino uses a programming language 
                    which similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"><u>C programming language</u></a>. If you 
                    don’t know C programming language then don’t try to learn it completely at once and then start programming arduino, just learn 
                    some basics and syntax of the following :- variable, functions, loops, arrays. After reading them go to the 
                    arduino<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/"><u> reference page </u></a> and learn about the arduino functions, variable and 
                    library. But i will suggest you to learn it by starting with the small projects such as blinking led etc. by searching tutorials on 
                    the internet and try to understand each line of code. Build more and more and ultimately you will learn how to code on your own. I 
                    will explain something to you that will make your further learning easy.

                </p>
                <p>On the first page of the IDE you must had seen something written like this, if you haven’t then take another look 
                     <img src="img/ide-code.jpg" alt="pre written code on arduino" class="img content-img img-responsive"> 
                     Some of you who know nothing about programming will not be getting anything, let me explain it to you. These are nothing but 
                     just two functions void setup() and void loop(). Now you will be thinking what a function is :- <i>function is a block of 
                    code which performs a particular task.</i> void is the return type and setup is the name of the function; the pair of parentheses() 
                    is like a sign that it is a function and the opening and closing curly braces mark the starting and ending of the function 
                    respectively.And in between those curly braces we write our block of code. Void is the return type and setup is the name of the 
                    function; the pair of parentheses() is like a sign that it is a function and the opening and closing curly braces mark the 
                    starting and ending of the function respectively and in between those curly braces we write our block of code.
                </p>
                <p>So all the arduino programs have at least two functions i.e. void setup() and void loop(). In the setup() function we set up 
                    our pins that which pin will be used for the sending output and which one is for taking inputs. It runs only for one time as 
                    the program starts running. You can set your pin mode using pinMode() function. For example for setting up the pin 13 for the 
                    output you will write:-</p>
                <div class="code"> 
                   <p>
                     void setup(){<br>
                        pinMode(13,OUTPUT);<br>
                        }
                        
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>pinMode is also a function but it is a prewritten(inBuilt) function, it takes a pin and its mode as its argument. Here pin is 13 and 
                    its mode is OUTPUT.</p>
                  <i>Note :- We must use semicolon after each line otherwise the program will not compile and throw an error(semicolon represents the 
                      end of the line).</i>
                <p>void loop() is a function where we write the things we want to do. It runs infinitely till the board is powered. For example :-
                    For blinking of led using pin 13.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <p>
                     void loop(){<br>
                        digitalWrite(13,HIGH);<br>
                        delay(1000);<br>
                        digitalWrite(13,LOW);<br>
                        delay(1000);<br>
                        }
                        
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>Above program will repeat itself after it ends so the led will blink till the board is powered.Let us understand this piece of code, 
                    In the loop() function we have used two other functions for achieving our desired outcome, first one is digitalWrite() and 
                    second is delay(). digitalWrite() is also a inBuilt function which used for writing the high or low to the pins which are set for 
                    output using pinMode function(we have setup the pinmode for 13 in the first example), writing HIGH to pin means providing 5v supply 
                    and writing low to the pin means providing 0 volt supply. Practically it means that in the case of HIGH the light will glow and in the 
                    case of LOW the light will be off. So you can see digitalWrite also takes two arguments the first is ‘pin’ and second is ‘output state’ 
                    i.e HIGH or LOW. There is one more function in the above program i.e. delay() function. It’s work is to freeze the board for few 
                    seconds. Here freezing means to stop the board from executing the next command for the inputted time interval. It takes only one 
                    argument which is the no. of milliseconds(1sec=1000ms). In the above code we have provided the value of the 1000 that means the 
                    led will remain glowing for 1sec and after that it will get turn off and then it will remain turn off for 1sec and this whole 
                    process will repeat till the board is powered.
                    So you got the code for your starter project let me merge them for you :-
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                   <p>
                    void setup(){<br>
                        pinMode(13,OUTPUT);
                        }<br>
                        void loop(){<br>
                        digitalWrite(13,HIGH);<br>
                        delay(1000);<br>
                        digitalWrite(13,LOW);<br>
                        delay(1000);<br>
                        }
                         
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Use this code and get you started in the hardware world. Before moving towards the ending note let’s summarize how can you make your 
                    first project :-
                </p>
                <p>
                    For making your first you need a Arduino UNO board, led, jumper wires, resistor, and an IDE. After all this you need to write 
                    your program or the above program in the IDE and compile after successful compilation of the code you must connect your board 
                    to your laptop/desktop via USB and then click on the upload icon after the successful upload. Now connect the led to gnd and 
                    pin 13 to complete the circuit using the jumper wires.After completing  the circuit power the board using USB cable or the 
                    external power supply via power plug or using the Vin pin(recommended using via usb). And you did it HURRAY!. Enjoy watching 
                    the led blinking. You can also try to blink the led in different fashion for example by increasing the time interval of blinking etc.
